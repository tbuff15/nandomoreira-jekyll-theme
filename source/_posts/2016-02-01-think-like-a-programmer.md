Programmers come in all shapes and sizes. This is a part of their lives. Also many programmers are famous businesses people such as Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. There is a key to programming and that is: The Five Elements of the Developer’s mindset. The first of the mindset is to learn to strap in until the job is done. Especially when you are getting started, you will spend hours upon hours trying to find that one missed punctuation mark or one miss capitalized word that is causing you a syntax error. The zen of coding is that you have to learn to be calm and break the problem you are trying to find in the least steps possible, then go through line by line to try and figure out the bug that is causing this program not to work. You never give up, EVER. After you have been programming for a few years, it takes no time at all to find the bug, because by now you should have strategies to find them The second key to the mindset is to Learn to love pain, not to fight it. Life in general is very hard to get through especially coding, so you just have to deal with it and move on. If you are stuck, try something different and then move on. The third mindset is to remember why you are doing this in the first place. You are doing coding to change the world and the people in and around it. Coding is part of the next generation, and if you are a programmer then you are apart of it. The fourth aspect of coding is to remind yourself, everyone needs help at some point in their coding career. The biggest mistake is that the beginners don’t ask for help, even experts don’t even ask for help because they think they are always right. That’s what google is for, and plus right off of google there is a great website called stack overflow, that has over 300 million answers. The fifth and final aspect of coding is to have fun! This is very hard, but remember always to have a sense of humor because that always lightens the mood.
